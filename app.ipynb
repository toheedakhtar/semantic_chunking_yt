And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Good evening. I'm Steve Jobs from Apple Computer, We're very glad to be here tonight. I think you always had to be a little different to buy an Apple computer. And I think you still have to think differently to buy an Apple computer. And I think the people that do buy this. still have to think differently to buy and have a computer. And I think the people that do buy them, they are the people that are not just out to get a job done, they're out to change the world. What a computer is to me is it's the most remarkable tool that we've ever come up with. And it's the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds. This is IMAG, the whole thing is translucent. You can see into it. It's so cool. Please to announce today that I'm gonna drop the interim title. Please to stand at the intersection of technology and humanity. And to make something for people that want to bring this into their lives and use it for things that make them more creative, not just make them more productive. This amazing little device holds a thousand songs because right in my pocket. An iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator. An iPod. A phone. Are you getting it? And we are falling it. iPhone. We have a chance if we stay focused and choose wisely to really continue to impact people's lives in some small way for the better. There's an old Wayne Gratsky quote that I love. I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been. And we've always tried to do that at Apple, since the very, very very begin and we always will.
